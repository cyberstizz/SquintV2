### Synopsis
Dedicated to the teachings and philosophies like the late great Kobe Bryant
and Floyd Mayweather jr. Squint is a "Structure For Success"!

Squint is a productivity web application that will follow the strucure of a task management system. the application will allow users to monitor some of the most important aspects in life when it comes to goal achievement. The app will use Google compatible calendars to create what we call "A Structure For Success".


### Goal Setting
this application is centered around goal setting. since every action has some 
motivation or end goal behind it, it is the core of the Squint application.


### whats the catch
users can net set a goal without an expeted time to complete it, as well
as steps that will be taken to complete it in the users daily schedule.
because this, users are forced to hold themselves accountable.




### Code Review

### final thought
Squint is designed to help anyone on their journey to achieving their aspiriations in life. the more people that I can help do that, the more successful this project is. further, the constant challenges that I have encountered during the execution of this project has been helpul to my coding journey in an immesurable way.
